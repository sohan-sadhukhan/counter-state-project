## Some Points :

- I have created three different counters on three different pages.
- To go to each page, I have put the page links in the Navigation menu and used the Next.js `Link` component to load the page quickly.
- Each counter is a separate part, so I made separate components for them.
- I used the card component and button component of `Shadcn` (A Lightweight Code Distribution System) to create the counter's card.
- I have used local state( `useState()` ) so that when the button is clicked the value of the counter display is updated.
- I used the `useState` updater function within a separate helper function to improve code readability.
- In the expert counter, Iâ€™ve implemented both a button disable mechanism and an `if` statement to enforce the count limit, providing double protection to prevent issues like race conditions.
